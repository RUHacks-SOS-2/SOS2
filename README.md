Who are we?
We are Supporting our Seniors, Supporting our Students or abbreviatedly known as (SOS)2. We are team of biomedical engineers eager to solve the world's next challenging problem with the power of Google Cloud. 

What is the problem?
Due to the on-going pandemic, at-risk populations such as the elderly have been instructed to stay at home and to socially distance themselves from others as much as possible in order abstain from contracting COVID-19. This pandemic did not limit its impact solely to public health. The economy has taken a massive hit and unemployment amongst the population has never gotten this bad this quickly. People are struggling to make ends meet and are actively trying to find employment. This is especially difficult for student's as the mountains of debt and no work experience that could make them an adequate candidate for a job.
